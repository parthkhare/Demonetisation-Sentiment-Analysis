On 30th August, 2017, http://pib.nic.in/newsite/PrintRelease.aspx?relid=170378 Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has reported in their Annual Accounts that Specified Bank Notes (SBNs) of estimated value of Rs. 15.28 lakh crore have been deposited back. Demonetization was envisaged with the broad objectives of: (i) flushing out black money, (ii) eliminate Fake Indian Currency Notes (FICN), (iii) to convert non-formal economy into a formal economy to expand tax base and employment and (iv) to give a big boost to digitalization of payments to make India a less cash economy. The cost of this experiment was loss of jobs (undocumented) largely in the informal labor sector, in addition to more than 100 deaths. The following exercise however, presents an analytic account of the behavioural response on demonetization from 3 lakh tweets. The first segment focuses on the context, methodology and results of the sentiment analysis. The latter section includes comprehensive R codes used for the analysis.
